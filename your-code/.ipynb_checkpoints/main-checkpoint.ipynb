    "In this lab you will first learn the following code snippet which is a simple web spider class that allows you to scrape paginated webpages. Read the code, run it, and make sure you understand how it work. In the challenges of this lab, we will guide you in building up this class so that eventually you will have a more robus web spider that you can further work on in the Web Scraping Project."

And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie?

She may not be thinking about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that she knows you can break—her heart.
